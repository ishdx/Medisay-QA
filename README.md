# Medisay-QA
Medical is a user-friendly online and mobile application for medication management. It reminds the patients to take their medicines at the prescribed time and to visit their doctor during their appointments. In addition, the patient’s information is shared with a person who advises them and takes care of their health. The patient’s adviser will be able to monitor the patient’s health improvements and check whether they take their pills and attend their appointments on time. The application also keeps track of the patient’s measurements (blood glucose, blood pressure, weight, etc.) and sends a report of them occasionally to the patient’s adviser and doctor. The sole purpose of Medisay is to help patients take care of their health effectively, in addition to facilitating the follow-up of their health by their families and those who care for them, from anywhere and at any time. The application aims to make patients' lives easier and healthier, especially the elderly and Alzheimer's patients.
